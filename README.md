# SenpaiGPT

Paying 20 USD per month for GPT-4 is too much for me so I made the (bad) decision to code up a quick and dirty ChatGPT clone to use GPT-4 without subscribing!

Made with Typescript, TailwindCSS, NextJS in React, hosted on Vercel, sign-in, and chat data linked to Firebase.

Since this is a minimum viable product it's super scuffed with many minor bugs like having to choose a GPT model before using since my code on setting a default model isn't working.

I'm also still trying to figure out how to make the queryAPI section handle different props/arguments for different models, especially considering legacy completion and chat completion models have vastly different inputs.

I might update this I might not, we'll see I guess.

Website address redacted since anyone with a Google account can log in and abuse my GPT-4 API :(
