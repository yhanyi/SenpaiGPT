# SenpaiGPT

Paying 20 USD per month for GPT-4 is too much for me so I unwisely tried to code my own ChatGPT website despite being behind in schoolwork.

I'm still trying to figure out how to make the queryAPI section handle different Props for different models.

I might update this I might not, we'll see I guess.
